# Go To-Do

An example web app that enables to-do list functionality following common patterns established by the Go community and detailed by [Mat Ryer](https://grafana.com/author/mat_ryer/) in this [blog post](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/02/09/how-i-write-http-services-in-go-after-13-years/).

The project aims to use stdlib packages where possible to minimize dependencies (i.e. no frameworks).
